# Loan Approval Prediction
A machine learning project to predict loan approval status based on applicant details. This model helps financial institutions automate the decision-making process and reduce manual work.

## Features
Data preprocessing with pandas and Label Encoding.

Multiple machine learning algorithms:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Random Forest Classifier

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Logistic Regression

Model evaluation using accuracy score.

Model persistence with pickle.

Data visualization using matplotlib and seaborn.

## Dataset
The dataset contains applicant details like:

Gender, Marital Status, Education

Applicant & Coapplicant Income

Loan Amount, Loan Term

Credit History, Property Area

Loan Status (Target variable)

## Model Performance
Accuracy varies by algorithm; Random Forest and Logistic Regression performed best.

Feature importance analysis included.

## Technologies Used
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

Pickle for model storage
